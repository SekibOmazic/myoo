# Make your own observables

This is my attempt to implement the [ECMAScript Observable proposal](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable)

It is heavily inspired by the [Ben Lesh's artice](https://medium.com/@benlesh/learning-observable-by-building-observable-d5da57405d87) 
and [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs). 

One big difference to the [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) is that RxJS uses the `lift` operator to create 
an observable and has far less (none?) closures.

## Why?

Well I just want the truly understand Observables and thought the good way would be to implement them. This is very 
simple implementation and by far not complete. For the production you would probably want to use [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)
